===========================

The Principle of Relativity is discovered through a thought experiment. Lorentz boosts and basic features of Special Relativity are qualitatively discussed with the aid of Minkowski diagrams. Quantitative description of the Lorentz group is developed following Lie's approach. Particle action, energy and momentum are discussed and spacetime forms of the action principle and Noether's theorem developed.

The notation uses colored balls as indices, since they highly improve the readibility of the indexful formulas. For compatibility reasos, a version with traditional Greek indices is also provided.
