I am Konsta Kurki, a student of physics at University of Jyväskylä, Finland. The content of this webpage is a manifestation of the passion and love that I feel for the beautiful subject of theoretical physics.

I write about the core ideas of physical theories. My approach is strongly physical and purely theoretical, and the purpose of the texts found here is only to build understanding. Teaching the reader to calculate is not a priority and emphasis is not put on applications or mathematical questions unless it helps to understand. I dislike clunky formulas and do my everything to make the notation as clear and simple as possible.

I thank Jarkko Saltiola and Karri Kuivanen who carried out the technical implementation of the website. I would not have been able to do it by myself.
