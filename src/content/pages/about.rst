My name is Konsta Kurki. I am a student of physics in University of Jyväskylä, Finland. This blog is a manifestation of my passion and love for the beautiful subject of theoretical physics. I mostly write about the core ideas of physical theories, but sometimes also about applications, methodology and general thoughts concerning the subject.

I am greatly thankful to my friends Karri Kuivanen and Jarkko Saltiola who carried out the technical implementation of the site. Technologies used include Pelican, Mathjax and Disqus.
