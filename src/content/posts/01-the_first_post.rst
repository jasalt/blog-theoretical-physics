While reading books on physics over the last two or three years, there has grown a will in me to write my own book. I have a strong feeling about what kind of a book or a series of books I would like to see to exist. It would be one with purely theoretical approach, focusing only on building understanding of the deepest concepts - with no energy wasted on mathematical subtleties, unnecessary applications or fine calculation techniques - and rooted in firm physical grounds, guided by common sense and everyday observations.

Something somewhat along these lines has been done, for instance The Course of Theoretical Physics by L. D. Landau and E. M. Lifshitz. But the approach could be even more theoretical and naked. Further, it has been decades since Landau & Lifshitz, and much has happened after them. And, of course, I just want to dip my own spoon in the soup.

Nine months ago, at Christmast, I started first time to write. I had to stop soon because I realized that my understanding was not on the level needed for explaining the concepts to other people But my personal standard of quality is that the text must be the best of its kind - what could be the point of a text which is worse than some other?

It is amazing how the understanding seem to grow somewhat exponentially in due time. From here and there you pick up some pieces of knowlede which themselves are worthless, but which together become a map of - it is not unfair to say - everything. You just realize which pieces connect to which.

At this point our map of everything is astonishingly good, but not perfect, the biggest hole we are aware being the marriage of gravity and other forces. Some people talk in the fashion that our present theories are only effective limits of some great underlaying theory of everything, perhaps string theory for example. I would not dare to swear in the existence of such great theory, but I definitely hope - and shyly believe - that we can improve our present theories, which have not channged since the seventies.

Anyway, something happened and in the late spring I noticed that I could write. I think I am in a position that I can write about classical physics, including Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, field theories, classical statistical physics and perhaps even a little bit of General Relativity. I hope that I acquire a deep enough understanding of quantum physics, in a sense of being able to write about it, in a year or two.

Instead of trying to write a complete book at once, I decided to write articles which could some day become chapters of the book. I have alredy written one article, about Special Relativity, and two more are in writing. I will publish the articles on this website. Hopefully I have the energy to carry this project far - however, a fast pace of update should not be expected.
