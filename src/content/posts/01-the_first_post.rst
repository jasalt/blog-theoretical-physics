:description: Theoretical Physics is articles about physics written in purely theoretical approach, the only objective being to build understanding. Hopefully someday the articles become a real book on theoretical physics.

While reading books on physics over the last two years, a will to write a book of my own has grown in me. I have a strong feeling about what kind of a book or a series of books I would like to see in my bookshelf. It would be one with a purely theoretical approach, focusing only on building understanding of the core concepts - with no energy wasted on mathematical subtleties, analysis of countless applications or fine calculation techniques - and rooted in firm physical grounds, guided by common sense and as far as possible by everyday observations.

Something somewhat along these lines has been done, for instance the Course of Theoretical Physics by L. D. Landau and E. M. Lifshitz. But the approach could be even more theoretical and naked. Further, it has been decades since Landau & Lifshitz, and much has happened after them. And, of course, I just want to dip my own spoon in the soup.

Nine months ago, at Christmas, I started writing for the first time. I had to stop soon because I realized that my understanding was not on the level needed for explaining the concepts to other people. My personal standard of quality is that the text must be the best of its kind - what could be the point of a text which is worse than some other?

It is amazing how the understanding seems to grow somewhat exponentially in time. From here and there you pick up some pieces of knowledge which themselves are worthless, but which together become a map of - it is not unfair to say - of everything. You just have to figure out which pieces connect to which.

In 2014 our map is astonishingly precise. Buit is not perfect, the most obvious hole in it being the conflict between gravity and quantum theory. Some people seem to be quite sure that our present theories are just effective limits of some great underlying 'theory of everything', perhaps string theory. I would not dare to take the existence of such great theory for granted, but I definitely hope - and am shyly ready to believe - that we can do better than we do now.

Anyway, something happened and in the late spring I noticed that I could write. I believe I am now in a position that I can write about classical physics, including Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, electromagnetism and perhaps General Relativity. I am hoping that I acquire a deep enough understanding of quantum physics and statistical mechanics, in a sense of being able to write about them, in a year or two.

Instead of trying to write a complete book at once, I decided to write articles which could some day become chapters of the book. I have alredy written one article, about Special Relativity, and two more are in progress. I will publish the articles on this website. Hopefully I have the energy to carry this project far - however, a fast pace of updates cannot be expected.

I am glad to have friends like Karri Kuivanen and Jarkko Saltiola who coded the website. I would not have been able to do it by myself. Very big thanks to them.
