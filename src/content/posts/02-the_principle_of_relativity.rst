:summary: The first article I have written deals with Special Relativity.

The first article I have written deals with Special Relativity. As a subject, Special Relativity seems to be a kind of an outcast - in elementary texts it is treated poorly while more advanced works assume it to be thoroughly known.

I aim to fill that gap - to build Special Relativity from scratch, guided by common sense and using the most transparent mathematical concepts, for example small or infinitesimal transformations. The reader is assumed to be familiar with calculus, basic linear algebra and the Lagrangian formulation of classical mechanics.

The abstract
============

The Principle of Relativity is discovered through a thought experiment. Lorentz boosts and basic features of Special Relativity are qualitatively discussed with the aid of Minkowski diagrams. Quantitative description of the Lorentz group is developed following Lie's approach. Particle action, energy and momentum are discussed and spacetime forms of the action principle and Noether's theorem developed.
