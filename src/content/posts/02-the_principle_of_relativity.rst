The first article I have written deals with Special Relativity. As a subject, Special Relativity seems to be a kind of an outcast - in elementary texts it is treated poorly while more advanced works assume it to be thoroughly known.

Beacause of that, before the writing I had many critical gaps in my understanding of Special Relativity. For example, I did not know why it is said that mass is equivalent to energy. Nevertheless, I managed to figure out these gaps and were able to write a logically continuous text about the core of Special Relativity. I hope the text fits in the mentionend spot between most elementary and advanced texts.

In the text it is assumed that the reader is familiar with the basic mathematical concepts of calculus and linear algebra. The Lagrangian formulation of classical mechanics using the Principle of Least Action is assumed to be understood.

The text makes a heavy use of index notation in which I have decided to use colored balls as indices. Because some printers and e-book readers do not support color and some people do have difficulties in differentiating colors, a version of the article using traditional Greek indices is also provided. If possible, I recommend reading the colorball version, because the colors highly improve the readability of the indexful formulas.

The abstract
============

The Principle of Relativity is discovered through a thought experiment. Lorentz boosts and basic features of Special Relativity are qualitatively discussed with the aid of Minkowski diagrams. Quantitative description of the Lorentz group is developed following Lie's approach. Particle action, energy and momentum are discussed and spacetime forms of the action principle and Noether's theorem developed.
